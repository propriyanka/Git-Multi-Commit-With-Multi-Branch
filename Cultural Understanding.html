        <p class="title"><b>Teamwork and Professionalism Skills:</b></p>
        <p>Teamwork skills are the skills that enable you to work well with others. Candidates with strong teamwork skills are sought out by employers for many reasons—they demonstrate leadership, collaboration, and good communication.<br>

            Employers expect employees to be team players. Teamwork is required for almost every industry, ranging from business solutions to information technology to food services.<br>
            
            This is true even if it seems like your job is best suited for an independent worker. You may perform the bulk of your job duties alone, but you should be able to think of your work in the context of the company’s broader goals and communicate your accomplishments to other people within the organization<br>
            
            Learn what teamwork skills are, types and examples of teamwork skills, and ways to develop your skills.<br><br>
            
            <b>What Are Teamwork Skills?</b><br><br>
            Teamwork skills involve your ability to work cooperatively with others.1 Regardless of your role, you need to be able to work well with others and convey your teamwork skills to hiring managers, recruiters, and prospective employers.<br>
            
            Scan any job listing, and you will see that even ads that seek “self-starters” also inevitably use the phrase “team player.” Those who have teamwork skills like communication, collaboration, leadership, and a positive attitude can help a team be more productive.
            
            Alternate Names: cooperation, collaboration
            Use examples of these skills in your resume and cover letters. Try to include quantifiable data like numbers, percentages, or dollar figures to show what you've accomplished working on a team.
